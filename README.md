# AnalysisofSortAlgorithms

Design an experiment to compare following four sorting algorithms: 
1. Insertion-sort, 
2. Merge-sort, 
3. Quick-sort (pivot is always selected as the first element) 
4. Quick-sort with median-of-three pivot selection

I decide on some sample inputs (large lists with different characteristics) to best clarify
the differences between the above algorithms. While doing our empirical analysis, use physical unit of time, 
but also count actual number of basic operation's executions.
I also compare our findings with theoretical complexity values.

This analysis has three main steps:
Step 1: Designing the Experiment
Step 2: Coding and Running
Step 3: Illustrating and Analyzing Results
